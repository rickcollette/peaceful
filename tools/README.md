# Tools

This is a set of standalone tools that I use regularly.
Things like generating UUID4 values, password hashing, etc.
They are'nt required to be used with peacful router or jaht, but I use these things with REST most often and thought I would save myself (and maybe others) some time by just offering these little 1-offs here.

## Tools

### GenerateUUID
  - call with ```uuidString, err := tools.GenerateUUID()```
  - returns a UUID-4 value
